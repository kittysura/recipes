# Fried chicken recipe 
## Crispy outer shell and soft and juicy inner everytime

The reason I buy fried chicken from select few franchises in my country is due to how bad fried chicken is cooked in Bangladesh.
No regards for softness, they only pay attention to outer layer. So I developed my own fried chicken recipe, and whenever I want
to cook some in my own home instead of ordering, I will use this recipe to cook some delicious fried chicken at home. 

### Before you get started

There are multiple steps involved in making this recipe, so I will also divide the ingredient list and process by steps. **This recipe is based on 5 large drumsticks (total weight 500g).
Adjust for your own usage based on chicken pieces and weight.**

### Step 1: Brining process

Prepare these ingredients first:

- **Chicken drumstick or wing** - I started with 5 pcs, the ingredients are based on that
- **Salt** - 1/4 table spoon per litre of water
- **Water** - As required to submerge the drumsticks fully
- **Sour curd** - 2 table spoon
- **Lemon juice** - 1 table spoon
Submarge the drumsticks with enough water, then add the ingredients. Give it a mix and keep it soaking for 2 hours. After soaking for two hours, gently dry the chicken by patting them
with kitchen towel or napkins. Keep it aside for the next step.  

### Step 2: Marinate

Prepare these ingredients for marination first:

- **Salt** - Half table spoon
- **Red chilli powder** - 1 table spoon
- **Black pepper** - half table spoon
- **White pepper** - 1/4th table spoon
- **Garam masala mix powder** - as required or you can skip it
- **Optional Chicken bullion powder** - 1/4th table spoon (optional)
- **Paprika** - 1/4th table spoon
- **Onion powder** - half table spoon
- **Garlic powder** - half table spoon
- **Ginger powder** - half table spoon
 
Mix all the ingredient with the meat thoroughly and keep it in fridge for minimum of four hours. You can keep it for the whole night if you want. The more the merrier. After marinating,
keep the marinated meat aside and prepare for the next step. Don't touch the meat before that.

### Step 3: Make batter

Prepare batter before preparing the flour for coating. Here are the list of ingredient needed for making simple batter:

- **Egg** - One egg is all you need
- **Milk** - Less than a half a cup of milk
- **Optional sprinkle of black pepper**

Whisk the egg in a medium bowl, then add the milk. Sprinkle the black pepper if you want, it's optional. Keep it aside.

### Step 4: Make flour for coating

Prepare the flour for coating the drumsticks:

- **Conrflour and flour** - Per 1.5 cups of flour, add half cup of cornflour
- **Salt** - Half table spoon (without salt in the coating, you won't like it until you bite in the meat)
- **Black pepper** - 1 table spoon
- **Garlic powder** - 1 table spoon
- **Ginger powder** - 1 table spoon
- **Mixed ground herbs** - Sprinkle some as required

It's better to mix the coating flour with all the ingredients in a large bowl. You will be able to coat the chicken easily. 

### Step 5: Coat and fry

Now it's time to cook the chicken to perfection. This is exactly what I followed by order **READ CAREFULLY**:

1. **Keep your meat, batter and coating flour close to you:** This is crucial to save time, because when the oil is heated, you have a short window for action.
2. **Heat your oil in a frying deep pot:** Use a deep frying pot or a fryer, but do remember you will need the lid. Pour oil enough to submerge the chickens, in the pot, don't cover it. Set your cooker temp to high and
let your oil heat. Once it's heated (you can use a cooking thermometer to check if it's 325 degrees celcius, or just see if it started evaporating with slight white smoke). Once it's
heated, lower the temperature to low. You no longer need much heat now. 
3. **Coat your chicken:** Take a drumstick or any piece, then gently coat all the parts with the egg and milk batter. Then coat it with flour completely. You only need one good coating.
Unless you're a big of thick coating, in that case, this recipe ain't for you. 
4. **Put the coated chicken in the frying pot:** Now it's time to gently lower the coated chickens to frying pot, close the lid and 
**cook for 13-15 minutes, flip them if you need after 7 minutes. And check for the golden brown color before putting it up. Don't fry too much, or the meat will stiffen**
5. **Let it shed excess oil and cool to tolerable temperature:** Before serving, make sure to keep the chicken in a paper towel, or a dripping rack. To drip the excess oil and also cool
it to tolerble temperature safe for eating. Chicken still keeps cooking when you pull it out of the fryer, so don't bite it just out the fryer. 
6. **Serve with garlic chilli sauce or ketchup:** Now it's time to serve tasty, soft, juicy fried chicken with your favorite condiment. Remember, only the monsters like to dip them
in ketchup, everyone else prefers chilli sauce, or garlic sauce, or better stuff.
